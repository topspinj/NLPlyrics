# Applying topic modeling to song lyrics

This repo explores Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using song lyrics from [MetroLyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/). The dataset contains lyrics for over 380,000 songs.

We will use [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) to process the raw lyrics, and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.html) and [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) to perform topic modeling.
