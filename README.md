# Applying topic modeling to song lyrics

This repo explores natural language processing (NLP) techniques using song lyrics from [MetroLyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/). The dataset contains lyrics for 380,000 songs by 20,000 artists across 10 genres.

### Topic Modeling 

I used two types of topic modeling techniques on the dataset:

1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
2. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)


### Getting Started

The scripts in this repo have the following dependencies:

- pandas
- nltk
- sklearn
- gensim

You will need to create a `data/` directory and add the `lyrics.csv` file in order for the scripts to work. 

### Next steps

- Word cloud analysis
- Genre classification
